## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation
Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (st is installed into
the `/usr/local` namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

```sh
make clean install
```

## Running st
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

```sh
tic -sx st.info
```

See the man page for additional details.
